                    the Architecture Center Gallery. Works will focus on a single project for the duration of term to
                    synthesize relationships between spatial ideas, program, material, and technical systems. This
                    year the studio focused on the design of a new mixed-use development, restaurant, hotel and
                    a number of other programmatic elements such as a lap pool and event center.

                    current research interests regarding high-performance textile-composite structures. Working in
                    small groups, students will be given a kit of parts and led through a step-by-step tutorial
                    to produce a structural textile surface reinforced with resin.

                    Conceived as a speculative atlas –a roadmap to unknown territories– Driverless Urban Futures
                    presents a series of drawings and text that unpack the potential impacts of AVs on scales
                    ranging from the metropolis to the street. The work is both grounded in a study of the history of
                    urban transportation and current trajectories of technological innovation, and informed by an
                    open-ended attitude of future envisioning and design. Through the drawings and
                    essays, Driverless Urban Futures invites readers into a debate of how our future infrastructure
                    could benefit all members of the public and levels of society.

                    Architect Douglas Cardinal's path in life has seldom been as smooth as the lines on the
                    buildings he designs. An Anishinaabe raised in Blackfoot territory, Cardinal's curvilinear vision
                    has produced instantly-recognizable monuments to Indigenous culture in the national capitals
                    of both Canada and the United States to world acclaim. But even his landmark successes have
                    not come without controversy. Douglas Cardinal: Architect of the Future, directed by Andrée
                    Cazabon, offers an intimate portrait of an artist guided by his Anishnaabe culture to uplift
                    humanity towards hope and social justice.
