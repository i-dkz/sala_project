                    SALA is the school of architecture and landscape architecture at the University of British
                    Columbia, located in Vancouver, situated on the traditional, ancestral and unceded territory of
                    the Musqueam people. Deeply committed to the quality of the built and natural environment,
                    we are a close-knit community of scholars, designers, and makers brought together by a
                    shared collaborative spirit.

                    Our undergraduate and graduate programs, led by an accomplished, multi-disciplinary faculty,
                    teach students to become creative leaders, effective collaborators, and progressive agents of
                    change. We established Canada’s first dual architecture-landscape architecture degree
                    program, breaking new collaborative ground. Beyond our professional degrees, program
                    options range from an exploratory workshop for those considering a career in design, to postprofessional
                    degrees for practitioners to gain a new set of skills.

                    Outside the studio, our students have a range of opportunities to connect with diverse
                    communities. Yearly study abroad courses provide an immersive international experience. An
                    increasingly-robust selection of design-build projects and co-op opportunities offer invaluable
                    hands-on experience. A long tradition of active student organizations is SALA’s social
                    heartbeat.

                    design prize each year to individuals who have shown extraordinary talent and dedication to
                    make Canada a better place to live.

                    Our campus and our city are ideal laboratories to respond to the urgent human and
                    environmental issues of our times. Our position on Canada’s west coast connects us to a
                    number of communities, from Cascadia to the Pacific Rim. Alumni and friends of our programs
                    have played pivotal roles in shaping Vancouver into an internationally recognized example of
                    sustainable urban design. Drawing on this history, we continue to prepare collaborative,
                    community-minded designers equipped to become leaders in the fields of the built and natural
                    environments.
