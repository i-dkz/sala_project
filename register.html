                    <p>
                        Admission to UBC is competitive, and your requirements change depending on your
                        degree and campus of choice. All applicants must meet UBC’s general admission requirements
                        and English Language Admission Standard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you’ve chosen a degree and reviewed your admission requirements, it’s time to complete
                        the application. If you have a disability that will impact your ability to meet the academic
                        standards of your degree, you’ll have an opportunity to disclose it during your application.
